# Data_Structures_Final
Land Barron game for Data Structures final project (May 2019)

So far the program will pull up a correct game board that has at least one possible path. And when pass is selected two times in a row the game will end and the AI will choose a path. The path chosen is the cheapest and the lands chosen will change color and the profits are calculated and displayed corrected. The main issue to solve right now is whether to seperate the  findPath method to use other methods to make the code cleaner.
